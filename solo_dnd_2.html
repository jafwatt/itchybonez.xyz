                <h2 class="posttitle">The Why of Solo D&D</h2>
                <div class="timestamp">2024</div>
                <div class="postbody">
<p>
    I underestimated the importance of having tools to tell me why something was happening in my solo D&D sessions.
</p>
<p>
A missing ingredient is understanding why something is happening, why an NPC is there or what motivates a monster.

How do I work out the why? Random rolls need tables and can get repetitive quite quickly. Using my imagination is hard because I actually donâ€™t want to do that. I want someone, or something, to be imaginative about the store so I have space to be imaginative about my characters. So that means I need to get better and making random rolls less repetitive.
</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        Here is a table of motivations you can randomly select from. Use oracle rolls, or your imagination, to flesh them out.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr><th>Roll d6</th><th class="left">Result</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td><p>
            <strong>Survival</strong> - Are they facing some threat and struggling to survive? Do they not have safe water to drink or enough food to eat? Is the population suffering from some kind of disease or illness?
        </p></td></tr>
        <tr class="alt"><td>2</td><td><p>
            <strong>Community</strong> - Are they building a community? Are they looking for certain people to join their community? Are they dealing some unwanted elements in their community?
        </p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td><p>
            <strong>Greed</strong> - Are they looking to acquire more treasure? Are they adventurers looking for rewarding challenges? Are they extorters, blackmailers or kidnappers? Are they a criminal gang that preys on travellers?
        </p></td></tr>
        <tr class="alt"><td>4</td><td><p>
            <strong>Domination</strong> - Are they warlike and like to use force to defeat their enemies and acquire more land? Are they oppressive and keep the local population in check and under control?
        </p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td><p>
            <strong>Influence</strong> - Are they trying to spread their influence further? Are they seeking to gain influence over someone or somewhere? Are they under the influence of someone or something else?
        </p></td></tr>
        <tr class="alt"><td>6</td><td><p>
            <strong>Protection</strong> - Are they following a noble cause to protect someone or somewhere? Are they seeking protection from someone or something?
        </p></td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
        Next we need to think about what resources are available. Resources can take many forms. Roll as many times as makes sense to you and use oracle rolls, or your imagination, to flesh them out.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
<tr><th>Roll d10</th><th class="left">Result</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><p>
    <strong>Wealth</strong> - Do they have a lot of monitory wealth? Do they have lots of valuable items such as furniture, tapestries, rugs, etc? Do they have a lot of jewellery or precious stones?
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><p>
    <strong>Population</strong> - Do they have a lot of people in their community? Do they have strength in numbers? Do the people have a particularly strong bond and sense of community?
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><p>
<strong>Individuals</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><p>
<strong>Items</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><p>
<strong>Geography</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><p>
<strong>Natural</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><p>
<strong>Magic</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><p>
<strong>Cunning</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><p>
<strong>Allies</strong>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td><p>
<strong>Favour</strong>
</p></td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>
    Once you have motive and resources for your encounter, you can work out how they will play out.
</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
<tr><th>Roll d??</th><th class="left">Result</th><th>Motive & Resource</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><p>
