                <div class="timestamp">December 2024</div>
                <div class="postbody">
                    <p>
                        I underestimated the importance of having tools to tell me why something was happening in my solo D&D sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A missing ingredient is understanding why something is happening, why an NPC is there or what motivates a monster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How do I work out the why? Random rolls need tables and can get repetitive quite quickly. Using my imagination is hard because I actually donâ€™t want to do that. I want someone, or something, to be imaginative about the store so I have space to be imaginative about my characters. So that means I need to get better and making random rolls less repetitive.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is a table of motivations you can randomly select from. Use oracle rolls, or your imagination, to flesh them out.
                    </p>

                            <tr class="alt"><td>6</td><td><p>

                    <p>
                        Next we need to think about what resources are available to the group. Resources can take many different forms. They can be material, organisational or magical in nature. Roll as many times as makes sense to you and use oracle rolls, or your imagination, to flesh them out.

                            <tr class="alt"><td>6</td><td><p>
                                <strong>Natural</strong> - Does the group have access to natural resources of value such as a gold mine? Maybe they claim ownership of a forest or meadow that's the only place where a particularly important plant grows?
