                <h2 class="posttitle">Solo D&D, Part II - This Is The Why</h2>
                <div class="timestamp">December 2024</div>
                <div class="postbody">
                    <p>
                        I underestimated the importance of having tools to tell me why something was happening in my solo D&D sessions. My solo D&D experience started off well. The <i>The Solo Adventurers Toolbox</i> was working well and I was having fun. However, I began to feel that something was missing, or perhaps more accurately, some of the things I needed to do to make it feel like a roleplaying game felt too contrived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've struggled to get past this nagging feeling and have spent a lot of time wondering what I could do. Eventually I remembered a TED talk by <i>Simon Sinek</i>. He spoke about the principle where any enterprise of worth starts with <strong>why</strong> before the <strong>how</strong> and <strong>what</strong>. <i>Why</i> are my characters having this encounter? <i>Why</i> are these Orcs holed up in this abandoned ruin? <i>Why</i> does this NPC engage with my characters?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After thinking about ways to make <i>why</i> more obvious, without it feeling contrived, I settled on the idea of making my own random tables. I worked out there are 3 components to a good <i>why</i>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Motivation</li>
                            <li>Resources</li>
                            <li>Strategies</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Armed with a basic principle, and plenty of examples of how to make a good random table from <i>The Solo Adventurers Toolbox</i> I set about creating my system form generating a good <i>why</i>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is a table of motivations you can randomly select from. Use oracle rolls, or your imagination, to flesh them out.

                    <p>
                        Next we need to think about what resources are available to the group. Resources can take many different forms. They can be material, organisational or magical in nature. Roll as many times as makes sense to you and use oracle rolls, or your imagination, to flesh them out.
