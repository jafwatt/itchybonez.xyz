                <h2 class="posttitle">World Building</h2>

                <div class="postbody">
                    <p>
                        It's time to take my D&D world building to the next level!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By that I mean I have tried using Google docs and it just isn't the experience I need as a world builder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What am I looking for?
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Something I am happy investing time in to learn how to use it</li>
                        <li>Something that gives me the user experience I like, which is basically a wiki</li>
                        <li>Something free</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Investing in Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is possibly the most significant determining factor. I really don't want to spend my time learning a new system that probably doesn't align with my core skills. That rules out most off the shelf offerings. They all have an approach and a DSL that I need to learn. Most of them will be using a language I don't know like PHP.
                    </p>

                    <h3>User Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        I like organising documents in a wiki structure. It feels natural to organising them hierarchically and embed links to connect them contextually. I also like to keep things minimalist so I don't need all the bells and whistles you get with full blown wikis - just basic links will do for me.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Free</h3>
                    <p>
                        Who doesn't like something that's free. These days it seems everything has to have a subscription and I just can't afford to pay for everything. Sometimes it's better to spend my time then spend my money.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I know HTML and CSS and how to host websites</li>
                        <li>I like the HTML wiki experience and know how to build them</li>
                        <li>The only cost would be my time</li>
                    </ol>

                        I don't care if you think I'm wrong and I don't care if you're offended.  You might feel the need to tell me exactly how wrong and/or offensive I am.  If you want to mail me about something, good or bad, go right ahead but I make no promises. I might read it. I might not. I might respond. I might not.
