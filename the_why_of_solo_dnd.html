<p>
    I underestimated the importance of having tools to tell me why something was happening in my solo D&D sessions.
</p>
<p>
A missing ingredient is understanding why something is happening, why an NPC is there or what motivates a monster.

How do I work out the why? Random rolls need tables and can get repetitive quite quickly. Using my imagination is hard because I actually don’t want to do that. I want someone, or something, to be imaginative about the store so I have space to be imaginative about my characters. So that means I need to get better and making random rolls less repetitive.

One table I don’t have is a list of motives. Survival, warfare, greed, spreading evil, spreading good, building a community, protecting something or someone, 


What about resources? A motive and plan without resources isn't complete. What kind of resources do they have? Wealth? Individuals? Special items? Geographical advantage? Natural resources? The available resources, combined with motives, will dictate the plan and tactics so they need to come first.

A motive without a plan isn’t telling a story so I need tables related to things like strategies, tactics and methods. How are they going to achieve their motives?

<h3>Motivation</h3>

                        I don't care if you think I'm wrong and I don't care if you're offended.  You might feel the need to tell me exactly how wrong and/or offensive I am.  If you want to mail me about something, good or bad, go right ahead but I make no promises. I might read it. I might not. I might respond. I might not.
