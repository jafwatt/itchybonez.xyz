                <h2 class="posttitle">Epic Solo D&D</h2>
                <div class="timestamp">2024</div>
                <div class="postbody">
                    <p>
                        I recently started playing solo D&D. I've been part of a new TTRPG group for half a year or so and really enjoying. The problem is, I can't play as often as I'd like to. Only every other week. I stumbled across a YouTube video about playing D&D on your own. I'd never heard of this and found it fascinating. After watching a few videos, and even buying <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/252355/The-Solo-Adventurers-Toolbox">The Solo Adventurer's Toolbox</a>, I gave it a go.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Party</h3>
                    <p>
                        Taking some suggestions from the videos I had watched, I created two 1st level characters that would adventure together. A female human Ranger called Nirih and a male half-elf Warlock called Krezen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted two characters to make this feel a little more like a party and give me more avenues for developing stories and adventures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I didn't think too much about these characters beyond making an interesting combination that would have a good mix of abilities plenty of avenues to explore their backstories and develop their adventures. I could have played it safe with more standard classes but a Ranger and a Warlock immediately give some flavour to the characters.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Campaign Setting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since getting back into D&D, I had wanted to explore more of the settings. The DM running the campaign for our group was using a homebrew setting and I wanted to base my solo adventuring in something more familiar and supported with lots of source material.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of well established D&D campaign settings to choose from and I wasn't sure which to go for. I decided I would ask ChatGPT for some advice. I asked it the following.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>"Write a short comparison of the most popular D&D settings"</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This gave me a remarkably comprehensive summary of 6 different settings, including a break down of the tone/style, notable features and pros and cons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reading all the summaries, I decided <i>The Forgotten Realms</i> ticked the most boxes. But what are the best source books to use?
                    </p>
                    <p>I asked ChatGPT again.</p>
                    <blockquote>"What are the best books to learn about the forgotten realms setting?"</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This gave me 7 different books with an explanation of their purpose, why they are useful and who they are best for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I now had everything I needed to start building the world for my solo D&D party.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Initial Sessions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Playing D&D solo was a new experience so the first few sessions were mostly about learning how the mechanics are different and how it _felt_.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was really pleased with how engaging it was and using tables and dice rolls to generate content worked well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I soon realised there was a problem; it was hard to think of a purpose for the characters without some kind of overarching quest.                        
                    </p>
                    <h3>Creating An Epic Quest</h3>
                    <p>
                        To create an epic quest for my solo party, I decided to use the same question/answer mechanic from _The Solo Adventurer's Toolbox_. This mechanic had worked well for sessions so far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started off by writing down questions about the nature of the epic quest:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it an invasion?</li>
                            <li>Is it an ancient evil?</li>
                            <li>Is it a cult or similar?</li>
                            <li>Is it a natural disaster?</li>
                            <li>Is it a mysterious illness?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first set of rolls gave be nothing but No's so I just rolled them all again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got invasion, cult and natural disaster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, I need to add some more structure so I wrote some more yes/no questions to ask:
                        
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h2 class="posttitle">The Perfect Podcast</h2>
                <div class="timestamp">2nd November 2024</div>
                <div class="postbody">
                    <p>
                        For a long time now I have been trying to find a podcast that has the perfect mix of content, tone, personality and   longevity. I get bored very easily and have yet to find a podcast that I wanted to listen to for more than a few episodes.
                    </p>
                        It's entirely possible that there isn't a single podcast that ticks all my boxes. Maybe I need a few to cover all tbe basses. Finding more specialised podcasts would probably mean I get better content because the hosts can focus more.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What criteria do I use to evaluate a podcast?
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>Content</u> - I'm looking for content that focuses on science fiction and fantasy media in all its forms with an emphasis on Cyberpunk</li>
                            <li><u>Tone</u> - It has to be informational and not just a load of opinions that I probably won't agree with</li>
                            <li><u>Personality</u> - I need to like listening to the people and not get irritated or bored</li>
                            <li><u>Longevity</u> - It needs to be active with regular episodes every week or more</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What candidates have I found?
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>??</u> - ??</li>
                            <li><u>??</u> - ??</li>

                <h2 class="posttitle">Media Fear Factory</h2>
                <div class="timestamp">3rd March 2024</div>
                <div class="postbody">
                    <h4>Why the Media Wants You Scared</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first thing to remember is that above all else, media companies are based on making a profit. They all have investors or shareholders who expect a financial return. Even charities and not-for-profit organisations have to generate some kind of revenue which dictates how they market themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then you have to think about how media companies drive revenue. They get people like you and me to consume their content. Doesn't matter if it's traditional television, streaming media, social media or radio - they all work the same. The more engaging the content, the more people it attracts and the longer they stay engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now think about what makes content engaging with the widest possible audience. We are fundamentally creatures of instinct and taping in to our flight or fight (or freeze) instincts is one of the most effective ways of getting our attention. It's easier to come up with things that create fear in people (financial hardships, personal danger, loss of liberty, intimidation, etc.) then the endless ways in which we find other kinds of gratification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever wonder why the media seems to be an endless loop of death, destruction and doom? Ever wonder why social media is so full of animosity, aggression and hated? Now you know. Stoking our fear is the cheapest way of generating revenue. We are the livestock and the media is farming us for all we're worth.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Information Warfare is Nothing New</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Cold War might be over (or is it?) but the tools of information warfare are just as useful to business and we have so much better tools these days. Algorithm-driven social engineering using vasts amounts of data harvested from a willing or oblivious population have become the norm. And it's not just dodgy states and cyber criminals using these tools. Respectable political parties and corporations use them too - they just use them to win votes or make you buy more stuff you don't need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe 'Influencer' is just another way of saying information warfare specialist...
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why Doesn't the Government Fix It?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once Pandora's box was opened it was too late. Tech-savvy political parties saw how effective and easy it was to manipulate narratives by fueling the fear factory media companies were only too happy to crank up to maximum output.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not much gets media frothing at the mouth more than a juicy political scandal and what politician passes up an opportunity to weaken a rival when an opportunity presents itself?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No, our political parties are not likely to give up one of their most powerful tools to achieve success.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why don't social media platforms fix it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Because it's not in their interests to fix it. They make money by farming data on the content you engage with. The more you engage, the more profit you make for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also prohibitively expensive to put in place the kind of oversight required to effectively police all the content on a social media platform. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's not a very good business plan to restrict your revenue stream and incur avoidable costs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What can little people like us do about it?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Choose our input and use our critical thinking. Decide if we trust the content we are consuming and consciously avoid content we know is only intended to distract or manipulate us.
                            <p></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stop. Turn off the 24/7 news channel. Break free from the infinite scrolling. Disable some of those push notifications. Unsubscribe from all those websites trying to make you buy shit you don't need and sell you data.
                            <p></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep things in perspective. Maybe the world is not in a worse state than it used to be. Maybe we're bombarded with so much information that it just feels that way. Go back a few decades and we just didn't have the kind of access to information we have now. Availability bias is real and insidious influence that takes a lot of effort to counter.
                            <p></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be part of the solution. Turn it off. Ask questions. Reply with authenticity. Be you and not just some livestock for others to profit from.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        The threat is existential and too big to fix by changing the rules. It might just be an inherent part of being human, our thirst for more knowledge, and we might just have to try and survive the information age.
                    </p>

                        For a long time I have been trying to put a name to the uneasy sensation I have been feeling. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever felt that something was wrong but couldn't explain what it was? Maybe you listed out all the things that were bothering you but none of them quite explained what you were feeling? Maybe you were finding the stuff you used to do to make yourself happy wasn't working like it used to?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well that's where I am and the itch I cannot scratch, the itch that seems to come from deep inside, in my very bones, is the need to openly say the things I can only say to myself or to a very select few people. The kind of things I'm not brave enough to say in person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that is the purpose of this page - to say the things I'm not brave enough to say because I <i>have</i> to say them.
