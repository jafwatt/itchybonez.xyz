                        I don't care if you think I'm wrong and I don't care if you're offended.  You might feel the need to tell me exactly how wrong and/or offensive I am.  If you want to mail me about something, good or bad, go right ahead but I make no promises. I might read it. I might not. I might respond. I might not.
