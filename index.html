                <div class="postbody">
                    <h4>Why the Media Wants You Scared</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first thing to remember is that above all else, media companies are based on making a profit. They all have investors or shareholders who expect a financial return. Even charities and not-for-profit organisations have to generate some kind of revenue which dictates how they market themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then you have to think about how media companies drive revenue. They get people like you and me to consume their content. Doesn't matter if it's traditional television, streaming media, social media or radio - they all work the same. The more engaging the content, the more people it attracts and the longer they stay engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now think about what makes content engaging with the widest possible audience. We are fundamentally creatures of instinct and taping in to our flight or fight (or freeze) instincts is one of the most effective ways of getting our attention. It's easier to come up with things that create fear in people (financial hardships, personal danger, loss of liberty, intimidation, etc.) then the endless ways in which we find other kinds of gratification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever wonder why the media seems to be an endless loop of death, destruction and doom? Ever wonder why social media is so full of animosity, aggression and hated? Now you know. Stoking our fear is the cheapest way of generating revenue. We are the livestock and the media is farming us for all we're worth.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Information Warfare is Nothing New</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Cold War might be over (or is it?) but the tools of information warfare are just as useful to business and we have so much better tools these days. Algorithm-driven social engineering using vasts amounts of data harvested from a willing or oblivious population have become the norm. And it's not just dodgy states and cyber criminals using these tools. Respectable political parties and corporations use them too - they just use them to win votes or make you buy more stuff you don't need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe 'Influencer' is just another way of saying information warfare specialist...
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why Doesn't the Government Fix It?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once Pandora's box was opened it was too late. Tech-savvy political parties saw how effective and easy it was to manipulate narratives by fueling the fear factory media companies were only too happy to crank up to maximum output.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not much gets media frothing at the mouth more than a juicy political scandal and what politician passes up an opportunity to weaken a rival when an opportunity presents itself?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No, our political parties are not likely to give up one of their most powerful tools to achieve success.

                        For a long time I have been trying to put a name to the uneasy sensation I have been feeling. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever felt that something was wrong but couldn't explain what it was? Maybe you listed out all the things that were bothering you but none of them quite explained what you were feeling? Maybe you were finding the stuff you used to do to make yourself happy wasn't working like it used to?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well that's where I am and the itch I cannot scratch, the itch that seems to come from deep inside, in my very bones, is the need to openly say the things I can only say to myself or to a very select few people. The kind of things I'm not brave enough to say in person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that is the purpose of this page - to say the things I'm not brave enough to say because I <i>have</i> to say them.
